There are lots of exercises you could use to strengthen your Python skills. One of these exercises is an alarm clock, which you can write as a single script file. You can also run it using a command prompt. In the alarm clock script, the user needs to set the time they would like the alarm to go off. The Python script will then display a ""Wake up"" message to the user when the alarm goes off. You can also add a countdown to show the user how long they have to wait until the alarm goes off.";makeuseof.com;1483;news;CA;en;Sharlene Khan;https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Alarm-Clock-on-Table.jpg;False;@MUO_official;17.285526;45e10414f738cb9cc760ab01fb11fc67
